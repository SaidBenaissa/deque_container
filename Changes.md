Changes made:

- Added #include <string> for the std::string class.
- Removed unnecessary comments and added more concise comments to describe the purpose of the code sections.
- In the main() function, changed const Customer next_customer = waiting_line.front(); to const Customer &next_customer = waiting_line.front(); to avoid creating an unnecessary copy.
- Added a std::cout << std::endl; after the loop that prints the remaining customers in the waiting line to separate the output of each iteration.
